## Abstract:
The project aims to provide a visual representation of crime data in Boston to help people choose a safe neighborhood when searching for accommodation. The project uses a dataset with ten columns, including incident number, offense code, offense code group, offense description, district, reporting area, shooting, occurred on date, uniform crime reporting (UCR) part, and street. From these columns, the five most important variables were chosen to represent the data visually. The visualization includes bar graphs, column charts, and a pie chart, and the data is segregated and sorted by year, locality, crimes, year, month, and week.

The resulting webpage offers a comparative analysis of crime rates in different localities of Boston and highlights the top ten safe neighborhoods according to the dataset. The project can be used by Boston residents searching for new accommodation or newcomers to the city. In the future, more interactive and intuitive visualization techniques will be incorporated to make the webpage more engaging and informative for the audience.
